Mobile Hacker News reader. Designed with an eye on performance. Run it on Dokku or Heroku or Whateverku.

Develop
-------
Just get a newish version of node and run `make`.
Run the dev server with `make watch`.

Deploy to my server (after you get my SSH key from my cold, dead fingers) with `make deploy`.
